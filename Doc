Steps:

Authors *_* Books
-> ManyToMany relationship
Authors
- firstN
- lastN
- id
- Books

Books
- title
- isbn
- Authors
- id

- Gen the project
- Create pojo ->then to -> entities
- Now on to relationships => POJO -> Entity and id generation stra -> Then relationship
- Authors manyToMany on Set<Books> with mappedBy = authors -> in books pojo
- AND, in books pojo, JOINTABLE!!           # This was taken from his source
    - Join table is configuraed as we need to maintian the relationship
- Now, impl the hashCode and equals methods -> for jpa, and as well impl the toString()

- Now, Repository -> Spring dataJpa
    - create interface - impl crudRepo
    - Spring is going to provide the impl for the repo class.

- Now, commandLine runner
    - myClass will implement the commandLineRunner
    - And @Component -> Tell spring it is a spring managed component
    - AuthorRepo, and BookRepo are IN CONSTRUCTOR??? -> SPring will inject the beans ITSELF, even without autoWired
    - Did a add on the author and book, and then did a repo.count() to get count of data from h2

- Assign - Add publisher
    - Nothing fancy, just add a pojo - entity it - and save to repo with a runner
